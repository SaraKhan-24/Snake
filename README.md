# Snake Game

This Snake game is a project created by Sara Khan while learning web programming as a beginner. It's a classic rendition of the popular Snake game where the player controls a snake that moves around the game board, eating food pellets to grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself and the walls.

## Getting Started

To play the game, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser that supports HTML5 canvas. You can also host the files on a web server to play the game online.

### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites to play the game. Ensure you have a modern web browser installed.

### Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
- The snake will continuously move in the direction it's facing.
- The goal is to eat as much food as possible to increase your score.
- Avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. Colliding ends the game.
- Press the "Restart" button to play again after the game ends.
